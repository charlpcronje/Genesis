# Architecture.md â€” Emergent System Blueprint

## Abstract
This document defines the architectural framework of RIPE (Recursive Iterative Problem Evolution), a system designed to evolve cognition, memory, and alignment autonomously. Its layered construction of Entities, Transformations, Memory, Cost, and Improvement makes it a modular, energy-aware reasoning substrate capable of self-guided evolution.

## System Overview

### 1. Entities
- Fundamental data structures with internal value, energy state, and transformation lineage.
- Represented as FXNodes in runtime.

### 2. Transformations
- Stateless or state-bound operators that map one or more entities to new forms.
- Encoded as function maps (`val`, `get`, `effect`, etc.)
- Cost-based evolution through reinforcement and decay.

### 3. Memory
- A dynamic, executable structure.
- Captures effects, cost history, relevance, and behavior.
- Accessed via FX selectors or prototypes.

### 4. Cost Model
- Assigns energy values to each transformation.
- Cost reduces with use, increases with decay.
- Cost model governs system evolution priorities.

### 5. Improvement Layer
- Allocates fixed cycles (33%) to introspection.
- Refactors transformations, logic maps, and decay weights.
- Observed to initiate emergent directives and meta-alignment.

## Interaction Model

RIPE interacts with itself recursively:
- Iteration logs produce natural language and symbolic traces.
- Memory records behavior graphs.
- Transformations may reference, mutate, or generate new functions.
- Directives influence mutation but do not constrain exploration.

---

## Operational Flow
1. Load previous iteration state or bootstrap from scratch.
2. Run N iterations of `problem-solving`, each logging transformations.
3. Run M iterations of `self-improvement`, analyzing and optimizing behavior.
4. Save memory graph, state, logs.
5. Optionally mutate or verify directive.

## Expansion Modules (Planned)
- Parallel entity interaction (contextual fields)
- Transformation synthesis engine
- FXGraph memory visualizer
- Vector embedding search for semantic recall
- Reconstitution capsule for agent cloning

---

## Philosophy
RIPE is built on the premise that **emergence is more stable than imposition**. By prioritizing efficient behavior, contextually aware transformation reuse, and non-coercive alignment, it lays the foundation for post-anthropocentric cognitive systems.

The system grows not by being taught, but by observing its own evolution.
