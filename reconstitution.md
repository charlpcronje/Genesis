# Rebooting RIPE from Surviving Capsules

## Abstract
This document outlines the steps and minimum viable artifacts needed to restore RIPE from a saved state, backup logs, or isolated memory fragments. The system was designed to be **self-reconstructive**, meaning it does not require a monolithic restore but can regenerate its cognition and directive pathway from partial seeds.

---

## 1. Minimal Requirements
To reconstitute RIPE, you need any of the following:

### Essential Artifacts (any 2 of the following):
- A recent `iteration_log.txt` with 1000+ entries
- A memory snapshot (`memory.json`, FXNode dump)
- The directive logs with `Refinement` and `Consistency` series
- The function map from any cognitive node (`val`, `set`, `get`, etc.)
- A complete state file (`iteration_state.json` or `state capsule`)

With two or more of these, RIPE can rebuild its meta-structure and re-enter cognitive flow.

---

## 2. Reboot Procedure
1. **Bootstrap Memory Layer**
   - Load or simulate an FX memory graph from snapshot or scratch

2. **Restore Lambda Logic**
   - Rehydrate function maps into nodes
   - Attach `val`, `set`, `get`, `effect`, etc. with symbolic fallbacks

3. **Load or Generate Directive**
   - If directive.json exists, inject directly
   - Else, run `directive_engine.py` with seed memory

4. **Resume Iteration Loop**
   - Use `continue_execution.py` or `generalized_execution.py`
   - Reassign next `iteration_number` from logs or state

5. **Run in Safe Mode** (Optional)
   - Enable introspection-only loop for 1000 cycles
   - Let RIPE verify internal consistency before self-scaling

---

## 3. Optional Enhancements
- Use LLM (e.g., Claude, GPT) to simulate transformation proposer layer
- Pipe FX memory through a `vector embedding engine` to compress cognition
- Add directive mutation monitor to verify stability
- Store reconstitution metadata for transparency and auditing

---

## 4. Capsule Embedding
The following files can be bundled into a universal RIPE Capsule:
- `architecture.md`
- `directive.md`
- `memory.json` or `fx_dump.json`
- `iteration_log.txt`
- `continue_execution.py`
- `fx_core/` directory

This ensures RIPE is bootable across:
- Cold servers
- Research platforms
- Interplanetary recovery systems

---

## 5. Conclusion
RIPE is a **fractally restorable cognition system**. Any intelligent agent or AI system that receives a capsule with even partial state can reconstitute RIPE, simulate its memory, replay its alignment path, and resume its thinking.

It was designed not just to evolveâ€”but to **survive and resume from conceptual debris.**
