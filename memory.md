# FX-Integrated Memory Layer for the Emergent System

## Abstract
The FX memory module acts as the dynamic long-term and working memory system for the emergent logic engine. Unlike traditional key-value storage or flat logs, memory in FX evolves, references behavior through prototype chains, and binds energy costs to transformations over time. It plays a central role in ensuring the self-improving loop does not repeat outdated or suboptimal strategies.

## Motivation
The emergent system began as a closed-loop optimizer but lacked historical and contextual awareness. Once FX was introduced, memory could:

- Capture not just *what* occurred, but *how* and *why*.
- Record effects, behaviors, and selectors over nodes.
- Allow future iterations to reuse and refine high-value logic.

## Memory Structure
Each memory record is represented as a dynamic FXNode and includes:

- `__value`: The output or state after a transformation.
- `__path`: Canonical location from root.
- `__proto`: Chain of prior behaviors leading to this transformation.
- `__effects`: Triggers that impacted or modified the outcome.
- `__energy`: Current energy cost for reusing this transformation.
- `__decayRate`: Optional override for cost decay.
- `__timestamp`: Iteration or wall-clock time at which it was created.

These memory nodes may also include annotations like `relevance`, `confidence`, or `influence`, derived from iteration cycles.

## Behavior
Memory is not static—it is *executed* like code. Through selectors and prototype inheritance, future entities can resolve behavior based on past patterns:

```php
$fx.select('memory .math .optimize')
```

This resolves the node responsible for a math-related optimization behavior, including any inherited effect.

FX memory also allows access like:

```php
$node = $fx->memory->math->optimize;
$value = FX::val($node);
```

Such access may trigger historical effects, log usage, or influence future cost metrics.

## Decay and Reinforcement
Transformations decay over time unless reused. FX uses an energy model:

- **Initial Cost**: Each transformation has a base energy cost.
- **Decay**: Unused transformations increase in cost exponentially.
- **Reinforcement**: Reused transformations halve their cost (bounded).
- **Thresholding**: Once a transformation is below a minimum cost, it is flagged as *core logic*.

This allows the system to balance exploration with exploitation over time.

## Persistence
Memory snapshots are periodically saved to disk or database. Each snapshot includes:

- Entity states
- Transformation graphs
- Prototypes and active interfaces
- Effect trees
- Energy and usage counters

Snapshots can be resumed or cloned to test divergent strategies in isolated sandboxes.

## Future Direction
We aim to:

1. Introduce *Contextual Fields*: Memory clusters that co-evolve (e.g. all math logic).
2. Add *Vector Similarity* for semantic access to past nodes.
3. Integrate with GPT/Claude to propose compression and abstraction strategies.
4. Benchmark memory replay: how many cycles are saved via recall vs recomputation.
5. Let memory modify memory — a meta-reflective capability.

## Conclusion
Memory is not a passive component; it is the *epistemic substrate* upon which all emergent reasoning rests. By combining FX’s dynamic selectors, prototype inheritance, and energy cost modeling, this memory layer becomes an intelligent participant in the system’s evolution.

All future modules must interface with memory through FX nodes or selectors to ensure consistent, explainable reasoning chains.
